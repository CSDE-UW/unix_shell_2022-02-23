What is Linux and why use it?
File operations (scp [machine to machine],  piping, )


shell scripting – mention and give an example

git –mention

R, batch–example of a complete work flow

One bootstrap
Perhaps cat() or print() to show progress in out file
Perhaps pdf() dev.off() or ggsave() to make figures
Hyak stuff, queueing (slurm), jobs (bg, fg, &), sequential batch submission
Some repeated version of 9. With 3-5 sequential batch submissions for each user


piping commands (|)
pattern matching (grep = globally search a regular expression and print)
