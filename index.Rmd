# Introduction

This is the documentation for the CSDE workshop `Introduction to the UNIX shell`. All of the instructions, examples, output, and code are contained herein. The workshop materials are meant to be either self-guided or used in a live workshop.

## Prerequisites

The course assumes no prior knowledge of UNIX or Linux. However, we do assume that you have some knowledge of:

1. Using a command-line interface
    
    You may have experience with this in programming in R or other languages, or using the Windows/DOS command prompt, or the Mac OS terminal (which is actually a Linux shell)
2. How hierarchical file structures work
    
    You are likely familiar with this from using the Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder.
